# How to run code?
## Go
There is a Go module at `solutions/go`. Each problem corresponds to a folder and thus one top-level package of the module. In the folder, there is a source file and test file. For example. 
- solutions/go/add-two-numbers/add_two_numbers.go
- solutions/go/add-two-numbers/add_two_numbers_test.go

There is no `main.go`. In order to verify the solution, run go test. For example, 
```sh
cd solutions/go
go mod tidy
cd add-two-numbers
go test
```

## Java
There is a Maven project at `solutions/java/leetcode`. Each problem corresponds to a Java package. There is a `Solution.java` and `SolutionTest.java`. For example. 
- solutions/java/leetcode/src/main/java/fyi/peng/addTwoNumbers/Solution.java
- solutions/java/leetcode/src/test/java/fyi/peng/addTwoNumbers/SolutionTest.java

In order to verify the solution, run Junit5. For example, 
```sh
cd solutions/java/leetcode
mvn compile
mvn test -Dtest=fyi.peng.addTwoNumbers 
```
