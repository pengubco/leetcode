1. Does sort change the answer? No.
2. Does duplication change the answer? Yes.
3. In a sorted array, how many triples can have `a[i]+a[j]+a[k] = 0`? O(n^3).  
 	 How many unique triples? O(n^2). Assume `a[i]<=a[j]<=a[k]`, if two triples 
	 have the first two values equal, e.g., `a1[i]=b1[i] and a1[j]=b1[j]`, then 
	 `a1[k] = b1[k]`. Therefore, there are at most O(n^2) unique triples.  
4. Can we use hash to find `a[k]` after enumerate `a[i]` and `a[j]`? No. So how do we enumerate 
   efficiently? 
5. Sliding window. Fix `a[i]`, then slide the window starting with [i+1, n-1].
6. How to deduplicate triples? Because we check triples in non-decreasing orders, 
   duplicate triples can only happen between consecutive triples.  
7. One optimization of enumerating i. If a[i]==a[i-1]=x, we can skip i. This is because:
	 7.1. If a valid triple contains no `x`, then no need to start enumerate at i. 
	 7.2. If a valid triple contains at least one `x`, then it has already been found out when start enumerating at i-1.
